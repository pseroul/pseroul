I am passionate by anything related to green IT, green AI, social and environmental impact of IT and AI. 
On my profile you will find public resources and ideas with different levels of maturity. 

# Work & ideas

Here are the public repo I try to build: 
### [AI inference footprint](https://github.com/pseroul/ai_inference_footprint)
A python script to run several Ollama inference with different models and retrieve overall analysis and time series monitoring using Alumet.

### [IT Aging](https://github.com/pseroul/simu_it_aging)
An interface that simulates the SCI (https://sci.greensoftware.foundation/) impact of servers (both energy usage & embeddings) depending on the lifetime of the servers. 
Asumptions are taken to simulate efficiency gain through servers versions based on Green500. 
Servers location modifies the carbon intensity and thus the footprint and optimal lifetime of the servers.

### [Virtualization simulation](https://github.com/pseroul/simu_virtu_at_scale)
Simulate when it becomes an advantage to move to virtualization to save IT footprint. Myth to bust: moving from on-prem to cloud allowed to decrease IT footprint cause you do not need to provision for peaks of activities. 
Metrics: SCI

# Others works: 
Some awesome project to use: 
- **Alumet**: high frequency true monitoring for IT energy - https://github.com/alumet-dev/alumet
